                While working with the api we specially need to think of the security
                of our end points and the authentications related to it.

                in rest_framework with django we can set theses permissions in

                REST_FRAMEWORK is a dictionary that holds the key as permission classes,
                and the values can be mulitple so it is a python list. Note that the values
                and the key itself is str object of python which we call string in other languages.
                By default the value is set to AllowAny class which is the part of
                rest_framework.permissions module or file.

                <h2>Custom permissions</h2>
                <p>Internally, Django REST Framework relies on a <strong>BasePermission</strong> class from which all
                    other permission classes inherit. That means the built-in permissions settings like

                    to create custom permission class, we will inherit this <strong>BasePermission</strong>. Next, we

                    override the has_object_permission
                    method. To
                    create our own custom permission, we will override the has_object_permission
                    method.

            <h1>Authentication in Django REST FRAMEWORK</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Authentication</strong> is a proof of the user/ machine. It is usually done by sending
                some credentials that are private to the sender and after that the receiver verifies it with the
                stored key, value pairs. In terms of API, we can say that the authentication is important in order to
                update/
                register the resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>HTTP</strong> is a <strong>stateless</strong> protocol, which means that it does not maintains
                the state of each request. Every single request is new to it. So in order to retreive restricted
                resources
                every request have to be verfied by some means. Authentication over every request will delay the process
                and
                increases the overhead on the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                One solution to uniquely identify each user over the request, response cycle, is by passing a
                <strong>unique
                    identifier</strong> with each HTTP request. Django REST Framework ships with four different built-in
                authentication options.

                <strong>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)</strong> . These are another way that we can verfiy with the help of
                tokens.
                They are implemented using the third party packages.

                <p>
                    <strong>d3N2OnBhc3N3b3JkMTIz</strong> is the base64 encoding for wsv:password123.
                    User credentials are sent over by the template as &lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;.
                    The credentials are unencrypted. The primary advantage of this approach is its simplicity.
                    But there are several major downsides. First, on every single request the server must look up
                    and verify the username and password, which is inefficient.
                </p>
                <p> It would be better to do the look up
                    once and then pass a token of some kind that says, this user is approved. Second,
                    user credentials are being passed in clear textâ€”not encrypted at allâ€”over the internet.
                    This is incredibly insecure. Any internet traffic that is not encrypted can easily be
                    captured and reused. Thus basic authentication should only be used via HTTPS, the
                    secure version of HTTP .

                <h2>2. Session Authentication</h2>
                <p>
                    It is is a combination of <strong>sessions</strong> and <strong>cookies</strong>.
                    At a high level, the client
                    authenticates with its credentials (username/password) and then receives a session
                    ID from the server which is stored as a cookie. This session ID is then passed in the
                    header of every future HTTP request.
                </p>
                <p> When the session ID is passed, the server uses it to look up a session object containing
                    all available information for a given user, including credentials.
                </p>
                <p>This approach is <strong>stateful</strong> because a record must be kept and maintained on both the
                    server (the session object) and the client (the session ID).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basic Flow:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A user enters their log in credentials (typically username/password)
                    </li>
                    <li>The server verifies the credentials are correct and generates a session object that
                        is then stored in the database
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The server sends the client a session IDâ€”not the session object itselfâ€”which is
                        stored as a cookie on the browser
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On all future requests the session ID is included as an HTTP header and, if verified
                        by the database, the request proceeds
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once a user logs out of an application, the session ID is destroyed by both the
                        client and server
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the user later logs in again, a new session ID is generated and stored as a cookie
                        on the client
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The default setting in Django REST Framework is actually a combination of Basic
                    Authentication and Session Authentication. Django's traditional session-based au-
                    thentication system is used and the session ID is passed in the HTTP header on each
                    request via Basic Authentication.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h4>advantages: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        more secure since user credentials are
                        only sent once, not on every request/response cycle as in Basic Authentication.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is
                        also more efficient since the server does not have to verify the userâ€™s credentials each
                        time, it just matches the session ID to the session object which is a fast look up.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                <h4>disadvantages: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a session ID is only valid within the
                        browser where log in was performed; it will not work across multiple domains
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the session object must be kept up-to-date which
                        can be challenging in large sites with multiple servers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the cookie is sent out for
                        every single request, even those that donâ€™t require authentication, which is inefficient.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                <h4>conclusion:</h4>
                <p>
                    It is generally not advised to use a session-based authentication scheme
                    for any API that will have multiple front-ends.

                <h4>Cookies vs localStorage</h4>
                <p>
                    Cookies are used for reading server-side information. They are smaller (4KB) in
                    size and automatically sent with each HTTP request. LocalStorage is designed for
                    client-side information. It is much larger (5120KB) and its contents are not sent by
                    default with each HTTP request. Tokens stored in both cookies and localStorage are
                    vulnerable to XSS attacks. The current best practice is to store tokens in a cookie with
                    the <span style="font-family: monospace;">httpOnly</span> and
                    <span style="font-family: monospace;">Secure</span> cookie flags.

                <h4>advantages: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Since tokens are stored on the client,
                        scaling the servers to maintain up-to-date session objects is no longer an issue
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        tokens can be shared amongst multiple front-ends: the same token can represent a
                        user on the website and the same user on a mobile app
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                <h4>disadvantages: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The same session ID can not be shared amongst different front-ends, a major limitation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        tokens can grow quite large. Since the token
                        is sent on every request, managing its size can become a performance issue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It also only generates one token per user, so a user on a website and then later a
                        mobile app will use the same token. Since information about the user is stored locally,
                        this can cause problems with maintaining and updating two sets of client information.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)</h3>
                <p>
                    a new, enhanced version of tokens that can be added to
                    Django REST Framework via several third-party packages. JWTs have several benefits
                    including the ability to generate unique client tokens and token expiration. They can
                    either be generated on the server or with a third-party service like Auth0. And JWTs
                    can be encrypted which makes them safer to send over unsecured HTTP connections.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>conclusion:</h4>
                <p>
                    Ultimately the safest bet for most web APIs is to use a token-based authentication
                    scheme. JWTs are a nice, modern addition though they require additional configura-
                    tion. As a result, in this book we will use the built-in TokenAuthentication .

                <h2>Implementing the Token Authentication</h2>
                <p>
                    For implementing the authentication we need to tell the rest_framework to look at the
                    settings specified in {project_root_dir}/settings.py file's variable called
                    <strong>REST_FRAMEWORK</strong>.
                    This is the same dictionary that we used to map the list of classes to be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, we are going to add another key/value pair to tell the authentication we are about to use.
                    Settings are just like json settings in vscode if you are familiar with it.
                </p>
                <code>
<pre>
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication'
    ],
}
</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    The tokens are generated on the server by app rest_framework.authtoken. Since, its an app
                    we will include it in {project_root_dir}/settings.py. Any, change in installed apps corresponds To
                    migrate command. So now, we will run migrations by: <code>python3 manage.py migrate</code>
                </p>
                <h2>creating end points</h2>
                <p>
                    We also need to create endpoints so users can log in and log out. We could create a
                    dedicated users app for this purpose and then add our own urls, views, and serializers.
                    However user authentication is an area where we really do not want to make a
                    mistake. And since almost all APIs require this functionality, it makes sense that there
                    are several excellent and tested third-party packages we can use it instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notably we will use django-rest-auth in combination with django-allauth to simplify
                    things. Don't feel bad about using third-party packages. They exist for a reason and
                    even the best Django professionals rely on them all the time. There is no point in
                    reinventing the wheel if you donâ€™t have to!
